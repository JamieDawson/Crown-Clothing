# Crown Clothing - an E-commerce website built in React, Firebase, and Netlify

I built Crown Clothing as a part of the online course [Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

It's a clothing store built with React as the frontend, uses Firebase for the backend, and hosted using Netlify.

You have the ability to sign in with Google, look through multiple categories of clothing, and create an online cart of clothes you want to buy.
